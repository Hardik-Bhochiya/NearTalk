# NearTalk

> **Ask your community. Know your place.**

NearTalk is a location-based social communication platform built with Flutter and Dart. It is designed to help people connect with others who live, study, or have experience in a particular region.

The platform focuses on helping newcomers, especially college students and people moving to a new city, get useful local information by asking questions and communicating with members of their region-specific communities.

## 📌 Problem Statement

When students join a new college or people move to a new city, they often do not know about the local culture, rules, food, sports facilities, important places, communities, or everyday practices.

Finding reliable information can require asking multiple people or searching through unrelated platforms.

NearTalk aims to provide a dedicated platform where users can:

- Join communities based on their college, city, locality, or region.
- Ask questions related to that specific community.
- Get answers from people who live or have experience there.
- Post questions anonymously or reveal their identity.
- Communicate with community members in real time.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a region-based social communication platform.
- Help newcomers understand their new college, city, or locality.
- Provide community-specific discussions and information.
- Support anonymous and public questions.
- Enable real-time communication between users.
- Create a growing knowledge base for different communities.

🌱 Future Vision

NearTalk aims to become a community-driven platform where every college, city, locality, and region can develop its own knowledge base.

A newcomer should be able to join a community and quickly discover:

📚 Academic information
🍴 Food and canteens
🏠 Accommodation and hostels
⚽ Sports facilities
🎉 Events and culture
📍 Important local places
💡 Tips from experienced members
📊 Project Status

🚧 Under Development

The project is currently in the initial Flutter UI and architecture phase.

👨‍💻 Development

Built with ❤️ using Flutter, Dart, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB.

NearTalk — Ask your community. Know your place.


### One change I'd strongly recommend

For your actual implementation, don't add every dependency immediately. Start with the Flutter side and add packages as you need them.

Your likely Flutter dependencies later will include:

- `http` → REST API communication
- `socket_io_client` → real-time Socket.IO communication
- `provider` or `riverpod` → state management
- `shared_preferences` → local session/preferences
- `geolocator` → device location
- `permission_handler` → location permissions
- `image_picker` → profile/media images
- `cached_network_image` → efficient network images

For the backend:

- `express`
- `mongoose`
- `socket.io`
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `bcryptjs`
- `cors`
- `dotenv`
- `multer` (when you implement media uploads)

**Don't install all of these now.** For the Lab 5 UI, you can start with essentially Flutter/Dart + the standard Material widgets. Then we'll add packages as each feature is implemented.

Also, the README's **Phase 1 checkboxes should be updated as you actually build each feature**—that m
